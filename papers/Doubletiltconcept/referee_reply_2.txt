We thank the referee for their quick and positive report and the detailed and constructive suggestions. We marked to relevant (i.e. not simple typos) changes in bold font.

We are aware of the problem with pre-viewing the interactive javascript. For security, all browsers today block loading of libraries from local files, unless you run a local server. On the other hand, AAS journals requires us to upload the interactive figures as files (instead of a link to a URL that we host) to protect the referee's annonymity. I promise that the interaction works fine for us and we will work with the data editor to iron out any kinks before publication.


>>> It may help, in the caption to Figure 2, to state explicitly that the torus is generated by rotating the circle around the dotted axis.

done.

>>> The concept of the blaze angle for CAT gratings, or ordinary reflection gratings, isn't defined anywhere. To make the paper self-contained, it would help to do so. And then
it will be clearer how the design process works: select blaze angle, then design Rowland geometry accordingly.

This is hard to describe in text, so we added a small figure to illustrate what the blaze angle is and how it is used in section 3.2 (the first step in the design process that uses blazed gratings).

>>> It may help, for the casual or first-time reader, to also produce a monochromatic version of Figure 5. If the reader has not fully realized that the ray traces cover a stretch of continuum, she or he may be confused by Figure 5. As it stands, the Figure folds together an array of independent concepts: subaperturing and resolving power, intrinsic astigmatism, the Rowland geometry, the double spectrograph idea. It might help to show the 'Green's function' for a single wavelength.


This is a great idea. We added another column of plots for a monochromatic simulation.
