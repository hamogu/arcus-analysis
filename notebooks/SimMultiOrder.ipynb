    "We will simulate order -5, in the `osiptouch` scenario. For that, we really need to simulate three spectra (the main order -5 and the true order -4 and -6 photons that errorneously get assigned ot order -5 in the order-srorting process using the CCD energies). Thus, we need three ARFs (`far_chan_all_ccdord_-5_true_-5.arf`, `far_chan_all_ccdord_-5_true_-4.arf`, `far_chan_all_ccdord_-5_true_-6.arf`) and the associated RMFs (`far_chan_all_-5.rmf`,`far_chan_all_-4.rmf`,`far_chan_all_-6.rmf `). When we analyze suc ha dataset that contains contributions from multiple orders, we simply load all three ARFs and RMFs into the same dataset and Sherpa will do the right thing. Unfortunately, `fake_pha` in the current version of Sherpa can only deal with single ARF/RMF pair, so we need to run three simulations and add the results together.

    "This plot shows the simulated data. Why are there three emission lines, when our input model had just one? The central line is the emission line seen in order -5 (green, hard to see on top of the blue data). However, in order -4 and -6 the same emission line gets diffracted to a different position on the detector and if we then resolve he events *as if the photons where order -5*, then we assign the wrong wavelength to the photons, leading to apparent emission lines in order locations. For the emission lines it's thus easy to see that the one in the middle if the emission line in order -5 and ones to the left and right are from order -6 and -4, respectively. Of course, the same happens for photons in the continuum, but there we do not have such a convenient way to say \"this photon is from that true order\". However, because the set up the (simulated) data correctly with all three contributing ARFs and RMFs, the total model (orange) \"knows\" about all contributions and describes all three apparent emission lines and the shape of the continuum.\n",

On the left side (short wavelengths) the confusing orders contribute of order 1% of the flux, on the right hand side (long wavelength) that's up to 10%. Only of there are strong emission lines a situation arises where the confusing orders contribute more counts than the main order at a specific wavelength. However, even the low-level contribution from the continuum may influence fitted parameters such as the powerlaw slope of the level or the depth of an absorption line if not taken into account properly in the fitting.\n",

Some orders (e.g. \"0\" or \"near_+1\") cover a pretty large range of wavelength, while orders (e.g. \"far_-9\") only have a fairly narrow wavelength range. Of course, we could make the plots above such that they all share the same x-axis in $\\lamba$ or in $m\\lambda$ but I found it useful to just show what's in eahc order. Now, we plot the O VII triplet in particular, because that is one of the interesting features in this star. In XMM-Newton, the O VII triplet was seen in the coronal limit (large f/i ratio). However, HD 163296 is hot enough that its UV field should change the level populations through photo-excitation, and the fact that we don't see that points to an X-ray emission that is a few stellar radii *above* the stellar photosphere, possibly in the collimation zone of the jet. So, I want to make sure we get enough counts in the O VII triplet to reliably measure the line ratio."

It's much stronger in order -6 than in -5 (look at the range of the y-axis), but nevertheless both orders contribute some signal, so, I probably want to fit them together. This is **not** the same as the interloping orders I discussed above. Order -6 contains true order -5, -6, and -7 photons, but the order -5 photons sorted into order -6 are so few that we don't see them and, because they are sorted into the wrong order, they would also be diplayed at a different wavelength (and $5 * 21.6 / 6$ Å). Similarly, order -5 contains a few true order -6 photons, but we don't see them here. What we *do* see is simply that the orders overlap in wavelength space."

That is good news, because photo-excitation would coud these smaller values. We could improve this analysis (e.g. the upper limit has no meaning for this experiment because it is set purely by atomic physics, not by the emission region), but, again, that's beyond the scope of this notebook. We could also go back and re-run the simulation with a smaller exposure time, which will give us fewer counts and presumably lead to a larger uncertainty. What is the shortest exposure time that still allows us to distinguish the photo-excited from the \"emission in the jet base\" scenario?"
