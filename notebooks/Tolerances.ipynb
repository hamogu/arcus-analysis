    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of alignment errors on the key performance characteristics of Arcus: Spectral resolving power and effective area. These numbers can then be used to guide the decision how to build up an error budget that specifies the allowable alignment tolerances for individual components. Naturally, there will be a trade-of: If one parameter is set looser, that will generally mean that all the other alignment tolerances have to be smaller. Science requirements put limits on the maximal allowable degradation of spectral resolving power and effective area and engineering constraints determine how well e.g. individual SPOs can be aligned into petals, how well the petals can the aligned to the forward assembly, and how well the forward assembly can be aligned to the detector housing. In general, tighter tolerances require more work, time, and money. We thus need to understand how important each possible degree of freedom is to the total performance of the system to identify those where significant design and work needs to go into the alignment. It is beyond the scope of this document to \"divy up\" the total allowable tolerance to individual alignment steps; instead, this document presents the results of ray-trace calculations for many different scenarios of misalignments and thus provides input for a broader discussion between scientists, engineers, and project managers of how to handle alignment tolerances.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some degrees of freedom in alignment only a ray-trace can really give the impact of misalignments, in other cases satisfactory estimates of the importance can be made analytically. Even in the second case, ray-trace calculations are a crucial cross-check, because they automatically take into account all possible effects, while analytical calculations often only consider the a first-order approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning, that the Arcus science would profit from an spectral resolving power or effective area above the defined minimum values for a baseline and threshold mission. For example, narrow absorption lines can be identified better with a higher spectral resolving power, potentially reducing the required observing time or making up for a loss in effective area. If technically feasible, the project will thus aim not to \"use up\" the entire misalignment budget, but to deliver a spectral resolving power above the minimum requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations start from a perfectly aligned version of Arcus. Even this does not provide infinite resolving power, because this model already includes non-ideal effects that are not due to alignment, most notably, pointing jitter, which blurs the direction of the incoming photons, scatter on the SPO mirror surfaces, some astigmatism inherent in the design, and finite sizes of CAT gratings and CCD detectors, which means that they deviate from the ideal Rowland geometry. A ray-trace is run with this design and spectral resolving power ($R$) and effective area ($A_\\mathrm{eff}$) are calculated.\n",
    "After running the baseline version, one element of Arcus is shifted in one degree of freedom, e.g. all CCDs are shifted by 1 mm in the dispersion direction. The ray-trace is repeated, again $R$ and $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ are calculated, then all CCDs are shifted by 2 mm and so on. After testing out the parameters space in dispersion direction, the CCDs will be shifted in cross-dispersion direction. In this way, each element (for example the CCD array), will be \"misaligned\" by various amounts in one of 6 degrees of freedom (shift along x, y, z, and rotation around x, y, z). In the first stage, only one degree of freedom is changed at a time, so there are no simulations where e.g. the CCD is misaligned in x, y, and z simultaneously. This is purely a computational limitation. Simulations are done for about 30 steps for each degree of freedom, which requires about $6*30=180$ simulations for the CCDs and similar numbers for SPOs, CAT gratings etc. Together, the first exploration where only one degree of freedom is varied at a time is based on several thousand simulations. If we wanted to explore the full 6-dimensional parameter space, we would need $30^6\\approx10^9$ simulations for the CCDs alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small tolerances it is not an unreasonable assumption that the misalignments in different degrees of freedom just add up and this can be used to build the total misalignment budget. Also, just looking at the results from the first stage, will identify some degrees of freedom where the alignment is easily (e.g. just from simple machining tolerances) much better than the requirements. In a second step, we can then run ray-traces where all degrees of freedom are varied according to the misalignment budget and thus check if the assumptions going into combining the misalignments in different degrees of freedom hold or if non-linear interactions degrade $R$ and $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ more than expected. In this case, we need to revise the misalignment budget appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the computational load reasonable, we simulate only one channel of Arcus. Since spectra from each channel will be extracted separately and there is symmetry between the channels, most results apply equally to all channels. We discuss in the text the few instances where the channel symmetry does not apply.\n",
    "Each simulation consists of 200000 photons and the same source photons are used for each series of ray-traces, e.g. all global CCD misalignments use the same photons. \n"

    "\n",
    "In most cases, six plots are presented. The top row shows translations, the bottom row shows rotations. The first plot in each row is the translation in (or rotation around) the global telescope $x$-axis, the second plot is for the $y$-axis, and the last one for the $z$-axis. The global Arcus coordinate system is formally defined in two memos written separately by major study group 1 and Ed Hertz. In short, the $z$-axis is parallel to the optical axis, the $x$-axis is the grating dispersion direction and the $y$-axis is the cross-dispersion direction. A short description and sketch of this system can be found in the [Rowland Torus memo](http://space.mit.edu/home/guenther/ARCUS/RowlandGeometry.html). In general, rotations are not done around the origin of the coordinate system, but around the center of an element (e.g. the center of a SPO petal); this is described in detail for individual elements below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each figure shows the shift or rotation angle on the $x$-axis and then plots the spectral resolving power ($R$) with a solid line, the value for $R$ can be seen on the left $y$-axis of the figure. Overplotted is the effective area with dotted lines, the value can be seen on the right $y$-axis of the plot. Note that these effective areas are for *one channel only*, so the total Arcus effective area will be four times larger. The exact numbers for the effective area are subject to change as we continue to develop the ray-trace simulation, for example, currently, the simulation does not include obscuration by a thin hexagonal support mesh under the optical blocking filter. However, most of the missing effects are just an overall factor and the *relative* change in $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ with increased misalignment is very robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray-tracing is performed for three different representative wavelength in the Arcus bandpass, shown as different colored lines on the plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the figures below, keep the following points in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each simulation is done with 200000 photons, so some scatter due to Poisson noise is inevitable. For some axis, $R$ is essentially unchanged, so that the y axis range is chosen from e.g. 4600 to 4800. While the lines on the plot zig-zag between the top and the bottom, the real change in $R$ is only a few percent, entirely consistent with Poisson statistics.\n",
    "- $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ is given summed over all dispersed orders that fall on a CCD and $R$ is the average resolving power, where the resolving power from individual orders is averaged weighted by the number of photons in that particular order. Thus, it is possible, that $R$ in the plot increases with increasing misalignment if $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ drops at the same time. This happens when an order with lower-than-average $R$ drops off the CCD (thus reducing the summed $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ and increasing the average $R$). There is no scientific benefit from the apparently increased $R$ here - if one required a higher resolving power, the lower orders can be ignored in scientific analysis even if they fall on the CCD.\n",
    "- Note that the zoom level for all axes (bottom, left, right) is chosen differently for each plot to highlight relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, there are two different ways to apply misalignments. In the first case, we apply a deterministic change to all elements at once, e.g. we shift the entire SPO petal by 5 mm to the left. In the code, this is implemented by shifting each SPO in the petal by the same 5 mm in the same direction. In this frame, a global rotation would mean that the entire SPO petal is rotated rigidly by some angle, so that the SPOs in the center move very little, while the SPOs on the outside rotate with a larger lever arm. These calculations are are done for a range of negative and positive values and are shown with a **grey** background. In the second case, we apply misalignments to each element individually. For example, we move the SPOs within the (stationary) SPO petal. In this case, the actual change for each SPO is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered on 0 and with a Gaussian $\\sigma$ corresponding to e.g. 5 mm. The *average* misalignment of all SPOs will be close to 0 in this case, but they are all shifted relative to each other. These simulations are shown with **light pink** background.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are a few plots with **light blue** background. These look at a loss of $R$ and $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ from changing Arcus design parameters, which are not alignment tolerances but do contribute to the width of the observed line-spread function. While the default for all alignment tolerances is 0 (and their values are only different from 0 in the section explicitly discussing their contribution to loss in $R$ and $A_\\mathrm{eff}$), the pointing jitter and the scatter from the SPOs (both in-plane and out-of-plane scatter) have non-zero default values. Both SPOs and star tracking system are not build by the Arcus team, but are supplied by other vendors. If all of these numbers were set to 0, Arcus in the simulations would reach very high values for $R$. As a consequence, even very minor misalignments in any axis would cause a significant (relative) drop in $R$, when in practice the alignment requirements are much more relaxed because of the width of the line spread function that is already introduced by the scatter from the SPOs."

    "### Pointing jitter\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointing jitter is not technically an alignment tolerance, but it affects the optical performance of Arcus in much the same way as misalignments between the optical components and it thus makes sense to treat it here. In this context, the \"jitter\" that matters is the uncertainty in the aspect solution, or, in other words, the difference between the true pointing direction and the tabulated pointing direction at the time of photon arrival. There are several reasons why the true pointing direction at the time of photon arrival might be unknown. They fall in two groups: First, the photon arrival time is only known within a certain time interval (the frame time). If the spacecraft moves between the beginning and the end of a frame, we cannot know where exactly it pointed when the photon arrived even if the spacecraft pointing was know perfectly all the time. To reduce this uncertainty, the spacecraft has to move slowly. Second, there are uncertainties to the instantaneous true pointing direction itself from e.g. fitting uncertainties for determining the centroids of the stars observed with the star tracker."

Here, we show simulations where the entire focal plane is shifted or rotated. The center of rotation is the point between the two CCD arrays. This can happen if the camera is mounted with some misalignment in the rear assembly or equivalently, this can represent a misalignment between front and rear assembly, e.g. a twist in the boom.

    "The plots show that the most important degree of freedom is a change in focus (\"shift along z\"). A shift along y is absolutely irrelevant, as long as it is small enough to keep the dispersed spectrum on the CCDs. For the particular channel simulated here that happens for y shifts for about -15 mm on one side and about +5 mm on the other side. A shift of 5 mm or more will drop at least one channel of the detector but in practice, this could be compensated by using offset pointing (placing the science target not on, but shifted with respect to the optical axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The curves for changing $R$ with shift in x (*top left*) show some spikes when an order hits a chip gap. For example, two orders contribute to the signal in the red curve. At -2 mm one of them hits a chip gap, causing a sudden drop in $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ and also in $R$ ($R$ is averaged over all contributing orders, but only one order which happpens to have a lower $R$ is detected at this position). Note that chip gaps are inevitable. There will always be some wavelength in a chip gap. At 0 mm it might be $35\\;\\unicode{xC5}$, at -1 mm it is $36\\;\\unicode{xC5}$, and at -2 mm it is $37\\;\\unicode{xC5}$. The overall performance of the instrument averaged over a range of wavelengths is unaffected by this. Shift along does x matter in principle because the focal plane is curved. If the CCDs move in the dispersion direction, the spectrum will be slightly out of focus but the plot shows that shifts up to a few mm have little impact. This opens an additional possibility to mitigate the effect of chip gaps. In the current design, we have two sets of 8 CCDs, which are symmetrical with respect to the mid-plane of Arcus except for a small shift of a few mm, which means that the two channels from one pair of petals will have other chip gaps than the channels from the other pair of petals. In this configuration each pair of channels will have the chip gaps at the same wavelength. Based on the simulation here, we can additionally introduce a small offset, say 4 mm, in x-direction between the two channels of the same petal pair. That way, no two spectra will have chip gaps at that same position.\n",

    "*Bottom row*: The bottom row shows the same phenomena as the top row. Rotation around the dispersion direction has little effect on $R$, rotation around z is only relevant once it becomes so large that the signal drops off the CCDs (about half a degree). Rotation around y (the cross-dispersion direction) is essentially the same as a defocus. This rotation makes the CCDs move up or down on a lever arm, causing the photons be the imaged at the wrong z position."

Shifts in x and y move the petal almost tangential to the Rowland torus and thus changes of even a cm or two have little effect on $R$, $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ only decreases because the gratings are carefully aligned under the petals and shifting destroys that alignment. A translation along the optical axis is essentially equivalent to choosing a Roland torus with a slightly smaller radius and that has little impact that long as the shift is small compared to the radius of the torus (6 m). The misalignment steps are chosen to densely sample the parameter space close to 0 and fewer simulations are done at larger shifts.

In practice the window frames will prevent that, but in the simulation some photons go through two CAT gratings and get dispersed twice, and several spots appear confusing the algorithm that calculates $R$. Note that a shift along z  (the optical axis) of even 1 mm is a big problem here, while a shift of the entire petal is not. If only a few CAT gratings are shifted up or down, then the photons which are diffracted earlier (closer to the SPOs) are traveling a longer path and make it further along the dispersion direction than photons diffracted at the nominal position, thus smearing out the orders and reducing $R$.\n",

Rotations in y quickly reduce $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ though, because the CCDs are placed for a certain blaze peak. Rotating the CAT gratings shifts the blaze peak and photons miss the CCDs. Rotation around z causes more and more signal to miss the detector. Unlike in the previous plot, there is no sharp cut-off, because the grating windows in the simulation have a distribution of rotation angles, and the larger the Gaussian $\\sigma$ is, the more CAT gratings will send their dispersed photons to positions where they cannot be detected."

    "This plot shows misalignment of CAT gratings with respect to the windows they are mounted to. It is very similar to the plot above, which shows misalignments of the windows with respect to the grating channel. What matters for the direction that a photons has after dispersion is the position and orientation of the CAT grating relative to the SPO. It is irrelevant if an misalignment is caused by the tolerance between CAT petal and window or between window and individual grating. The only difference is in rotations. In this plot, rotations are applied around the center of a CAT grating, while in the plot above, rotations are applied around the center of a window. Since windows are larger (they contain four or six CAT gratings), a rotation around the window center will move the edges of the CAT gratings more than a rotation around the center of each CAT gratings. Thus, the loss in $R$ is slightly higher in the previous plot than in this one."

The Marxs simulation does not model the shape of an SPO in 3D, instead, it uses a simplified model that treats each SPO module as a thin lens with perfect imaging quality. It then adds scatter in the plane of reflection and out of the plane of reflection. The magnitude of this scatter is matched to observed quantities for SPOs that have been manufactured and measured in the laboratory. For each photon, in plane and out of plane scatter is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a given $\\sigma$. For the plots above, simulations are done for different values for the in plane and out of plane scatter; the out of plane scatter was set to 0 for the simulations shown in the left plot, and the in plane scatter was set to 0 for the simulations shown in the right plot. For perfect mirrors, the maximum $R$ is about 10000; this number is limited by the pointing jitter that is included in these simulations (see above) and also by the finite size of the grating facets, which deviate from the ideal mathematical Rowland torus.\n",

First, ray-tracing is a Monte-Carlo simulation with a finite number of rays. It is thus always possible, that the signal in one run is narrower than in the baseline scenario just by chance. Second, misalignments are statistical. For each element they are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Thus, the predicted $R$ and $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ vary from simulation to simulation. The plots above show how $R$ and $A_\\mathrm{eff}$ change for the baseline alignment tolerances for the three wavelengths that are used throughout this document. On average, $R$ is reduced by about 2% relative to the baseline; indicating that the alignment budget is unlikely to degrade the performance significantly. However, there is a finite probability to loose more than 10% of $R$ for unlucky scenarios.\n",

Thus, the two plots above should not be interpreted as \"longer wavelength will suffer more\"; crucial orders are close to a chip gap in different spots over the Arcus bandpass.
