    "### What's in this document and what is not\n",
    "This document contains mostly results of simulations, not the code itself because many of the plots below require a grid of simulations, e.g. in for different energies, and take while to run. Thus, those grids are run in a separate process and the relevant results (e.g. the position of the final rays on the detector) is saved in a fits file. In this notebook we then parse these fits files to extract the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's included in the simulations?\n",
    "Details of the setup for the simulations are obviously defined in the python code, but a list of the most important effects that are included is here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On-axis, point-like source\n",
    "- Spacecraft pointing with jitter\n",
    "- Mirror with in-plane and out-of-plane scatter\n",
    "- two optical axes, each of them used by one pair of channels\n",
    "- SPO and grating facet positions identical with the mechanical design\n",
    "- facets are flat (i.e. simulation includes finite size effects)\n",
    "- CCDs are flat and have pixels\n",
    "- CCD gaps between individual chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "No simulation is perfect and there are many details of the Arcus design that are not or only very marginally relevant for the optical performance that are not covered in these simulations. The main caveats with respect to the optical design are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SPO model for a mirror is simplified. Instead of a full surface in 3d, SPOs are represented but a single reflection in a plane. Comparison with experimental data shows that this is a valid approximation for on-axis sources, but cannot reproduce the effects expected for off-axis sources (most notably, the vignetting).\n",
    "- Tolerances: Effective area and resolving power depend on the accurate placement of SPOs, CAT gratings and CCDs. The simulations here are mostly done placing all these elements at their nominal position."

    "This figure shows the resolving power averaged over all channels and all dispersed spectral orders. When averaging, values are weighted by their respective effective area. Some of the upward spikes seen in the previous plots are also visible here. In addition, there are some drops in $R$ that occur when a wavelength is observed where two orders with slightly different $R$ contribute and one of them falls into a chip gap for a certain wavelength. In the region $39-44\\;\\unicode[serif]{xC5}$ only a single order contributes, and so we see the $R$ rising with wavelength as in the previous plots. For small wavelengths $<12\\unicode[serif]{xC5}$ very low orders contribute to the signal, bringing down the average $R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, over most of the wavelength range, $R$ is almost constant. That is not a coincidence, but rooted in the physics of CAT gratings. The spectral resolving power is measured as $R = \\frac{d_x}{FWMH}$. The $FWHM$ is dominated by the mirror point spread function (PSF). In practice the PSF is slightly energy dependent, but this is not captured in the simple mirror model used for these simulations. All other effects on the $FWHM$ are very small (for example, it technically also depends on where on a CCD the signal falls since the CCDs are not curved and do not follow the Rowland circle exactly, but for Arcus this effect is negligible). So, the only variable left is $d_x$ the distance of the spot from the zeroth order. Photons of later wavelength are dispersed to larger distances and thus have larger $d_x$ which explains why $R$ increases with wavelength for every order. On the other hand, CAT gratings most efficiently diffract photons at a particular angle (the *blaze peak*). Thus, for longer and longer wavelengths the signal in an order becomes weaker, because the position of the order moves away from the blaze peak. At the same time, the next lower order moves towards the blaze peak and becomes increasingly stronger. In other words, the higher order (which has a higher $R$) drops in effective area, while the next lower order gains effective area. Together, this means that the averaged resolving power stays essentially constant."
