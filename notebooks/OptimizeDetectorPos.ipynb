    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCDs in Arcus are placed on the surface of the Rowland circle. Given the limited number of CCDs available the position along this circle needs to be selected carefully in order to capture the maximal signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Arcus is designed to follow a Rowland geometry. The [Rowland Geometry memo](http://space.mit.edu/home/guenther/ARCUS/RowlandGeometry.html) describes this geometry in detail and gives the exact parameters of the Rowland torus. In short, the Arcus spectrograph works by placing gratings on the surface of a torus and setting the CCDs on the opposite side of the torus. After passing through the CAT gratings the rays converge in both dispersion and cross-dispersion direction. When they pass the torus again, the distribution is the narrowest in the dispersion direction, thus placing the CCDs on the torus gives a spectrograph with the best possible resolving power. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different spectral orders are diffracted by different angles and thus land at different positions of the torus. The properties of the CAT gratings determine which orders have the highest signal and thus the CCDs need to be placed to catch those orders. Photons that are diffracted into higher or lower orders might miss the detectors and get lost. In an ideal world, every photon could be detected by placing a large number of CCDs, but in practice, coverage is limited because only 16 CCDs can placed on Arcus given the constraints in cost, energy, data volume, and size of the spacecraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this memo, I run a single ray-trace of the Arcus SPOs and CAT gratings. Then, I place CCDs at different positions along the Rowland circle and calculate the number of detected photons to determine the ideal detector placement. "

The black circle is the Rowland circle. X-rays come from above. The two blue lines mark the position of two optical axes. Colored boxes signify the CCD positions (three on each side in this sketch). The position of the CCDs can be parameterized in different ways, e.g. one could list the x and z coordinate of the CCD edges, or the coordinate of the center (the tilt of the CCD can then be calculated from the condition that it is tangential to the Rowland circle). In the following, we will use either $\\phi$, the angle between the centerline of the Arcus telescope (at x=0 in the global instrument coordinate system) and the inner edge of the innermost CCD, or the x coordinate of the innermost edge of the active CCD area (red line) as parameters. The edge of a CCD is a well defined location that can easily be measured during the construction and aligning of the telescope and is thus a more useful reference point than the center of a CCD."

    "\n",
    "Arcus has four channels, two of which disperse the spectrum along the positive instrument x axis and the other two disperse in the opposite direction, [see Fig 1 in the Rowland Geometry memo](http://space.mit.edu/home/guenther/ARCUS/RowlandGeometry.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "We optimize the CCD position taking a number of constraints into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 16 CCDs are split into two groups of 8 CCDs each. Each group of CCDs **has to capture two zeroths orders** (and associated low-order photons from the same channel) and dispersed signal from the remaining two orders. The zeroth orders are located at a fixed position (we currently use -375 mm and + 375 mm), the dispersed spectra cover a larger area.\n",
    "- There is about 0.8 mm of space between the last active column of a CCD and the physical edge of a chip. The closest possible distance between active CCD areas is thus 1.6 mm, but in order to mount them in the housing correctly, we need a small additional gap, leaving us with a minimum chip gap of 2.15 mm.\n",
    "- The CCDs need to be shielded from optical light by an optical blocking filter. These filters are only available up to a certain size. Each filter can cover at most 3 CCDs. The filters are surrounded by a small mounting frame, giving a minimum gap between X-ray transparent areas of 4 mm. It is clearly most efficient to place this filter support structure over a CCD chip gap (taking into account that the X-ray beam arrives at an angle). By placing the CCDs not just 2, but 4 mm apart we can avoid wasting active CCD area in the region that will always be shadowed by the filter support.\n",
    "- Most photons arrive close to the \"blaze peak\" and the signal becomes weaker further away from the peak. The center of the 8 CCD array will be set on that peak. Given that at most 3 CCDs can be covered by a single filter, the options are 2-3-3, 3-3-2, and 3-2-3. In principle, 3-2-3 is the worst of these options because both gaps are close to the center. We use a 2-3-3 scheme here, but note that in practice the blaze peak is so wide that this choice is not important.\n",
    "- The two zeroths orders should fall close to the center of a CCD. If they were close to the edge, we would risk to miss the zeroth orders for sources that are acquired slightly off-axis. The zeroths orders are needed to calculate the wavelength scale and having them fall in a chip gap by accident might render the observation useless.\n",
    "- Chip gaps will inevitably lead to gaps in wavelength coverage. To ensure that no wavelength is completely lost, the two sets of 8 CCDs will not be exactly symmetric to the instrument mid-plane, but offset with respect to each other by a few mm to ensure that any wavelength that is invisible on one side will be observed on the other."

    "This simulation uses a flat (in wavelength space) spectrum with photon wavelengths between 12 Å and 50 Å. Effective areas are calculated from the fraction of photons in some wavelength bin that are detected (e.g. if half source the photon in one energy bin are detected, that means that the effective area in this bin is half the geometric opening area).

Choosing a flat spectrum leads to similar noise levels in all wavebands that are analyzed in this memo.\n",

    "The plot above shows the simulated effective area curve zoomed in on a region around the O VII lines, which will be found between 21.6 Å and 28 Å depending on redshift. The gray area shows the sum over all dispersed orders (including very low orders like order 1, where the spectral resolving power is $<1000$); the colors are for individual orders. The left and the right plot use the same input photons, but slightly different detector positions. In each plot, the position of the chip gaps can be clearly seen. For most of the wavelength range, the effective area is dominated by one spectral order, but a few more are seen with a significant number of counts. If an order falls into a chip gap for a specific wavelength, the number of counts in this wavelength drops to zero. However, photons are detected in the other orders so that the total effective area dips, but is still different from zero. Because the detectors are in slightly different positions in the left and right plot, different wavelengths fall into the chip gaps. In the right plot, the CCDs are positioned at larger distance from the zeroth order and thus the order -6 is seen out to $25$ Å, while on the left plot, no order -6 drops off the CCDs are lower wavelengths. The situation is reversed at different wavelength not shown in this plot - the point is that even at the best possible detector position we will still lose some photons because they hit chip gaps or fall beyond the camera edges."

Thus, we do not always have a simulation where the zeroth order is lost completely. Even if the black curve does not go to 0, these parameters need to be avoided, because, as explained above, the zeroth orders need to be comfortable away from chip gaps anyway. Note that for the zeroth order we do not show the effective area on the y axis, but just some relative scaling marking the regions where the zeroths order is detectable at all. The requirement that each set of 8 CCDs must image two zeroths orders sets an upper limit for the inner edge of the innermost CCD at 300 mm, the location of the zeroth order.\n",

    "Looking at the colored curves, we see that the behavior is relatively smooth. Because we average over a range of wavelengths, individual chip gaps are not important here. Somewhere in the range of wavelengths, there will always be a chip gap. Instead, the shape of these curves is driven by the overall shape of the blaze peak. For the blaze angle and focal length of Arcus, the blaze peak is wider than the area captured by just 8 CCDs on each side. That is why the placement shows so little sensitivity between about 150 and 300 mm. For every photon lost on the one side of the CCDs, we pick up another one on the other side. This makes the design of the cameras and the focal plane easier - optical constraints do not require an exact value for the position of the inner edge of the innermost CCD, so this value can be found in trade-off between optics and engineering requirements.\n",

However, the asymmetry between the two sets of 8 CCDs places the chip gaps between the two pairs at slightly different positions as shown in the plot.

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robustness of results\n",
    "The simulation results in this memo include most known effects of the Arcus performance, in particular, the pointing jitter. On the other hand, MARXS uses a very simple model for the SPOs. While the absolute scaling of the effective area might carry some uncertainty, relative results (i.e. the relative change in effective area for different detector positions) are expected to be robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanical integration\n",
    "This memo does not address the problem of the mechanical integration, i.e. if the dimensions of the camera shown here fit inside the spacecraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of chip gaps on science\n",
    "Chips gaps are inevitable for any camera made up of discrete detectors. In Arcus, we mitigate this problem by not placing both cameras exactly at the same distance from the center line. That way, chip gaps introduce drops of no more than 50% in the effective area. Yet, that still leaves us with a very structured effective area curve with sharp drops and edges. What is the impact of this on the science taken with Arcus? There are different concerns here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When observing a target with spectral features at known positions (e.g. a star with known emission lines or an absorption line system where lines have been previously detected and now need to be studied in detail), a we can avoid to have interesting features in chip gaps by commanding an offset pointing which moves the zeroths order slightly off-nominal positions and thus moves the position of the chip gaps. **However, this leads to significant extra effort for the design of the observations and mission planning (it makes the nominal pointing position depend on the spacecraft roll angle at that time)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When looking for features at unknown position (science target one: Detect absorption features from hot baryons), an observation will be significantly less sensitive around the chip gaps due to reduced signal. Or, in other words: **To reach uninterrupted nominal sensitivity over the entire wavelength band, observations need to be twice as long.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In practice, uncertainties will be larger around chip edges then at the center of a chip.** That is true both for statistical uncertainties (e.g. for a line right at a chip edge, the continuum next to it can be fitted on one side only) and for calibration (e.g. if a line is fully on one chip, it's easy to fit the centroid, but if the peak falls in a chip gap and the fit can only be done to the line wing, the LSF model of the wings needs to be very good).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A proposal to reduce the effect of chip gaps\n",
    "There are two main ways to reduce the impact of the chip gaps and I suggest to implement both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [My alignment tolerance calculations](http://space.mit.edu/home/guenther/ARCUS/Tolerances.html) show that an offset in the x direction by a few mm has little influence on the resolving power, we thus decide to reduce the impact of the chip gaps by introducing a small (-2.5 and +2.5 mm with respect to the nominal position) offset between the two channels in each pair and at the same time set an asymmetry between the two CCDs sets (10 mm). This makes each chip gap no more than 25% deep and give them a quadruple humped structure. It also places the zeroth orders further apart from each other. On the one hand cross-dispersed zero-order photons will impact more regions of the dispersed spectrum, but on the other hand, that simplifies any calibration task that uses the zeroth order because the two zeroth orders in one pair of SPOs do not interact through read-out streaks and cross-dispersed photons. Examples are zero-order effective area (for QE calibration) or monitoring the PSF (in imaging or through the width of the read-out streak). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Dithering smears out any gap in effective area due to chip gaps, or CCD artifacts (hot columns, bad pixels) by making the wavelength that is effected time-dependent. Of course, Chandra is an example for a well-calibrated mission that uses dither successfully."
