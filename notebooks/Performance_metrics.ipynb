    "This document contains mostly results of simulations, not the code itself because many of the plots below require a grid of simulations, e.g. in for different energies, and take while to run. Thus, those grids are run in a separate process and the relevant results (e.g. the position of the final rays on the detector) is saved in a fits file. In this notebook we then parse these fits files to extract the relevant information.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What's included in the simulations?\n",
    "Details of the setup for the simulations are obviously defined in the python code, but a list of the most important effects that are included is here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On-axis, point-like source\n",
    "- Spacecraft pointing with jitter\n",
    "- Mirror with in-plane and out-of-plane scatter\n",
    "- two optical axes, each of them used by one pair of channels\n",
    "- SPO and grating facet positions identical with the mechanical design\n",
    "- facets are flat (i.e. simulation includes finite size effects)\n",
    "- a rough treatment of facet L1 and L2 diffraction\n",
    "- CCDs are flat and have pixels\n",
    "- CCD gaps between individual chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "No simulation is perfect and there are many details of the Arcus design that are not or only very marginally relevant for the optical performance that are not covered in these simulations. The main caveats with respect to the optical design are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SPO model for a mirror is simplified. Instead of a full surface in 3d, SPOs are represented but a single reflection in a plane. Comparison with experimental data shows that this is a valid approximation for on-axis sources, but cannot reproduce the effects expected for off-axis sources (most notably, the vignetting).\n",
    "- Tolerances: Effective area and resolving power depend on the accurate placement of SPOs, CAT gratings and CCDs. The simulations here are mostly done placing all these elements at their nominal position."

    "This figure shows the resolving power averaged over all channels and all dispersed spectral orders. When averaging, values are weighted by their respective effective area. The thick lines average truly over all dispersed orders including positive and negative orders. For all wavelengths, more than one order contributes and dips in $R$ occur when one order falls into a chip gap and the remaining orders have a lower $R$. One particular example is the drop around 35 Å. At this wavelength, order -3 and -4 have most of the signal, with a very small contribution from order +1. As -3 and -4 fall into chip gaps at the same wavelength, all that's left is order +1 which has a much lower $R$. This highlights the importance of a careful placement of the chip gaps or dithering to smooth out the gaps. Even without those measures, in practice the effected area at this wavelength is so low that it won't have enough signal to constrain models meaningfully anyway.\n",
    "The figure above shows a second set of red/black lines with are thinner. They show the averaged $R$, ignoring orders that contribute less than $20\\; \\mathrm{cm}^2$ of effective area, which leaves out the low positive order at longer wavelengths. Thus $R$ is slightly higher here, at the cost of a slightly lower effective area (not shown here, but effective ares for individual orders are plotted above).Drops in $R$  are still visible, but the spot around 35 Å is not a data gap. In the region 39-44 Å only a single order contributes, and so we see the $R$ rising with wavelength as in the previous plots. For small wavelengths $<12$ Å very low orders contribute to the signal, bringing down the average $R$. With the caveat that some technique to avoid chip gaps is employed (e.g. dithering or spacing out individual channels with more random offsets), this second curve is probably a better representation of the $R$ that will be used in typical science analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows almost no difference between the perfect alignment and the the baseline alignment tolerance scenario. This is consistent with the results in the [Alignment budget memo](http://space.mit.edu/home/guenther/ARCUS/Tolerances.html) where the drop in $R$ is only one or two percent. If at all, the baseline alignment tolerance curve looks a little smoother and the drops or peaks (e.g. around 46 Å) that happen when one order falls into a chip gap are less pronounced. This is likely just an artifact of the wavelength step used in these simulations. If the signal is spread out a little more on the CCD, then photons are still collected in cases where the perfect alignment scenario has insufficient signal to calculate $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over most of the wavelength range, $R$ is almost constant. That is not a coincidence, but rooted in the physics of CAT gratings. The spectral resolving power is measured as $R = \\frac{d_x}{FWMH}$. The $FWHM$ is dominated by the mirror point spread function (PSF). In practice the PSF is slightly energy dependent, but this is not captured in the simple mirror model used for these simulations. All other effects on the $FWHM$ are very small (for example, it technically also depends on where on a CCD the signal falls since the CCDs are not curved and do not follow the Rowland circle exactly, but for Arcus this effect is negligible). So, the only variable left is $d_x$, the distance of the spot from the zeroth order. Photons with a longer wavelength are dispersed to larger distances and thus have larger $d_x$ which explains why $R$ increases with wavelength for every order. On the other hand, CAT gratings most efficiently diffract photons to a particular angle (the *blaze peak*). Thus, for longer and longer wavelengths the signal in an order becomes weaker, because the position of the order moves away from the blaze peak. At the same time, the next lower order moves towards the blaze peak and becomes increasingly stronger. In other words, the higher order (which has a higher $R$) drops in effective area, while the next lower order gains effective area. Together, this means that the averaged resolving power stays essentially constant."
