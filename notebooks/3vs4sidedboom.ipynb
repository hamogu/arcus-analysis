    "The Arcus focal length is too large to fit a fully expanded spacecraft into the launcher. Instead, Arcus will have an extensible boom that is coiled up at launch and will be extended in space. If the boom is large enough, all the photons will be inside, but if the boom diameter is smaller, photons from the outer SPOs will have to pass through the structure of the boom. This is true in particular for a three-sided boom. In this notebook, I study how the shape and size of the boom affects the detected signal. \n",

Only a a small fraction of the outermost SPOs is larger than then boom and the photons have to pass from outside the boom to inside and some photons can be lost when they hit the elements the boom is made of. This is a relatively easy case, and is simulated first. As a design study, we then look at a 3-sided boom with different orientation and diameters.\n",
