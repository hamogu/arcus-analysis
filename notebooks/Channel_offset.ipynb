    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Arcus has four different channels, two dispersing in positive x direction and two dispersing in negative x direction. These channels are offset from each other in y (cross-dispersion) direction so that the traces can be identified separately on the CCDs. Each channel has gaps in its effective area when the photons hit a chip gap. For a fully symmetric layout, the four channels would have chip gaps at the same wavelengths, leading to gaps in wavelength coverage. For a steady pointing, this could lead to gaps in wavelength coverage. To remedy this problem, the CCDS are not placed symmetrically. One camera of 8 CCDs is placed a few mm further away from the geometric center of the focal plane. This is possible without a loss of resolving power, if the cameras are not exact copies, but the are CCDs located at slightly different heights in each camera to account for their different position on the Rowland torus. *This is the arrangement we proposed in 2018*.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this arrangement, only two channels have identical chip gaps. In this notebook, we look at moving the two channels that disperse in the same direction with respect to each other, so that chip gaps are distributed such that two channels never have a chip gap at the same position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How far apart are the chips?\n",
    "\n",
    "The widest gap from pixel edge to pixel edge occurs for chip gaps that are placed below the frame of the optical blocking filters. These filters are only as wide as 3 CCDs, and thus three frames are needed to cover the 8 CCDs of one camera. The gap here is 4 mm wide. Adding 0.5 mm margin on each side because the calibration is less accurate when part of the line spread function falls in a chip gap, channels need to be staggered by 5 mm. Note that displacing channels this way leads to a reduction in resolving power, because no longer are the channels using the same optical axis that is used to place the CCDs on the Rowland circle. However, a distance of a few mm is far below the tolerances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Will dither take care of it?\n",
    "Dithering between observations is another way to mitigate the impact of chip gaps. If the instrument dithers enough, it might not matter that the chip gaps are at the same locations for boresight pointing for two channels. A gap of 5 mm in the focal plane corresponds to the following dither on the sky:"

Since the grating equation is $m\\lambda = d\\;sin(\\phi)$ where $d$ is the grating constant, it natural to plot $m\\lambda$.
